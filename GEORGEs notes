Hello and thanks for taking the time to look over my tech test.
I used symphony as it seemed as good as any other MVC framework and
I found a github repository with symphony already packaged up in a docker env. Thus it can run on just about any "modern" operating system.

TODOs:

- Build in other API's to fetch more jokes.

- Large numbers of jokes break the webpage, put them inside a scrollable div or resize the page to fit more text.

- Handle failed requests (http response codes etc.) gracfully on both front-end and back-end.

- Return jokes as json to front end not a string with embbed html.

- Styling for sumbit button etc needs work.


Getting Started (Taken from README.md)

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images (This may take a while to build the first time)
3. Run `docker compose up` (the logs will be displayed in the current shell) (use `-d` to spin it up in a detached state)
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
   In chrome type "this is unsafe" to dismiss warnings (I don't know how you'd dismiss them in firefox sorry)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
